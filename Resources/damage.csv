 ""The 1991 eruptions of Mount Pinatubo produced enormous clouds of volcanic ash and corrosive gases. In the days after the eruptions, these clouds had an immediate impact on air traffic routes and aircraft flying in the Southeast Asia region. In addition, the corrosive gases from Pinatubo continue to affect aircraft through 1993.  The largest ash cloud, from the June 15 eruption, was carried by upper level winds to the west and circled the globe in 22 days. […]. Sixteen damaging encounters were reported between jet aircraft and the drifting ash clouds from the June 12 and 15, 1991, eruptions. Three encounters occurred within 200 kilometers from the volcano with ash clouds less than 3 hours old. Twelve encounters occurred over Southeast Asia at distances of 720 to 1740 kilometers west from the volcano when the ash cloud was between 12 and 24 hours old.

On April 14, lava from new fissures surfaced beneath the crater of the glacier-covered summit. The heat from the lava quickly melted and vaporized the glacier ice above. Mud, ice, and meltwater running off the volcano swelled local rivers and streams, especially the Markarfljót glacial river west of the volcano,[...]. Expanding gases from the rapid vaporization of ice started a series of moderate phreatomagmatic explosions (which result from the contact of water and magma) that sent a plume of steam and ash almost 7 miles (11 km) into the atmosphere.
